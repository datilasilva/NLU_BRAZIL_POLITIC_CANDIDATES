# NLU: BRAZIL POLITIC CANDIDATES


The idea is to analyze the sentences about the two candidates: Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Lula) and (Jair Bolsonaro (Bolsonaro) using Watson IBM, Natural Language Understanding (NLU).
Since I got to know the projects about NLU I was curious about the subject. A few days ago, I saw a video that analyzed human sentences about fruit using Natural Language Understanding(NLU). Then my curiosity told me...Why not?

So I opened an account with IBM and used Jupyter to start my 'educational game' by importing from IBM-Watson into my "emotions" code like RelationsOptions, EmotionOptions, and SentimentOptions.

I invited my network to play with me and asked them to send me sentences about the candidates for the presidency of Brazil with up to 5 words.

Hiding the most aggressive phrases, I had fun identifying the negative, positive and neutral phrases.

When my “study group” used phrases with words containing “demon” or “poverty”, the code response identified with a negative label (sadness around 0.6), obviously, the words “good” scored positively.

Ironies were disregarded and, in general, the response was “neutral” teaching me that we still need to teach machines a sense of humor.

It's Friday, let's play!
